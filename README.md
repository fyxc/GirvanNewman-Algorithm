# GirvanNewman-Algorithm
It is a class aasignment. 
In this assignment, I implement the Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm in Python for computing the betweenness of edges in a graph. 
* Only use the basic libraries in python.
* For extra, implementing a program in Spark that computes the edge betweenness in parallel.
